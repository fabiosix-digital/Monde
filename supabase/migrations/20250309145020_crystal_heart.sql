  # Create storage bucket for avatars

  1. Storage Configuration
    - Create 'avatars' bucket for storing user profile pictures
    - Enable public access for avatar images
    - Set up security policies for authenticated users

  2. Security Policies
    - Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
    - Allow public access to read avatars
    - Restrict update/delete to owner only
